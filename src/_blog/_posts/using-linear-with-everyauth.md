Recently Fusebit announced [EveryAuth](https://fusebit.io/blog/everyauth/?utm_source=fusebit.io&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=none) project that allows you to integrate with multiple services via OAuth easily. Learn how to use EveryAuth with Linear API using the [@linear/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linear/sdk) package.

You have an existing Express.js application that needs to integrate with Linear API to display the following information:
- Linearâ€™s user profile information
- Last 10 updated `Open` assigned issues
- A custom form for new linear issue creation

The application will look like this once you authorize the application to interact with your Linear account:

## Configuring EveryAuth

This blog post assumes you already have EveryAuth configured in your development environment. In case you donâ€™t, follow the [configuration steps](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express#getting-started) from the EveryAuth GitHub Repository.

A basic Express application will look like the following:

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Letâ€™s add support to EveryAuth and configure the Linear service so we can interact with their API.

## Install dependencies

For interacting with Linear API from Node.js we will use the official [@linear/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@linear/sdk)

```shell
npm i @linear/sdk
```

Install the [@fusebit/everyauth-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fusebit/everyauth-express) package

```shell
npm i @fusebit/everyauth-express
```

Install the [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) package. Used to generate a unique identifier for the userId.

```shell
npm i uuid
```
Install the [cookie-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session) package to allow your application to establish a session (an HTTP-Only cookie) to store the authorizing user id.

```shell
npm i cookie-session
```

## Add Routes

There are two critical routes we need to add to our application:

- Authorize route
- Finished route

Letâ€™s understand the role of each route:

### Authorize route

EveryAuth middleware enables your application to perform an authorization flow for a particular service.
EveryAuth provides an out-of-the-box shared Linear OAuth Client so that you can get up and running quickly.

EveryAuth simplifies a lot the authorization flow:

```javascript
app.use(
  '/authorize/:userId',
  (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.params.userId) {
      return res.redirect('/');
    }
    return next();
  },
  everyauth.authorize('linearâ€™, {
    // The endpoint of your app where control will be returned afterwards
    finishedUrl: '/finished',
    // The user ID of the authenticated user the credentials will be associated with
    mapToUserId: (req) => req.params.userId,
  })
);
```

You can define any name you want for the authorization route. In our previous example, itâ€™s called `authorize`, but itâ€™s up to you, and your application needs to use a different name/path. 

### Finished route

After the authorization flow finishes, control is returned to your application by redirecting the user to the configured `finishedUrl` in the `authorize` route.
The redirection includes query parameters that your application can use to know the [operation status](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express#authorizeserviceid-options).
You can use any path for the route. Just ensure it matches what you have configured in the `finishedUrl` property.
In this route, you can now interact with the Linear API by leveraging the EveryAuth service to get a fresh access token.

### Show User Profile and Last Ten Issues
 
We will get the information of the user who authenticated  with Linear n and also the last 10 `Open` issues assigned to them, using the REST API.

```javascript
app.get('/finished', handleSession, async (req, res) => {
  const userCredentials = await everyauth.getIdentity('linear', req.session.userId);
  const linearClient = new LinearClient({ accessToken: userCredentials?.accessToken });

  // Get the current authorizing linear user.
  const me = await linearClient.viewer;

  // Get the authorizing user teams used to select the team you want to use when
  // creating a new Linear issue.
  const teams = await me.teams();

  // Get the latest updated 10 'Open' assigned issues
  const myIssues = await me.assignedIssues({
    first: 10,
    orderBy: 'updatedAt',
    filter: {
      state: {
        name: {
          neq: 'Done',
        },
        and: {
          name: {
            neq: 'Canceled',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  });

 res.render('index', {
    title: `Linear demo for ${me.displayName}`,
    ...me,
    issues: myIssues.nodes,
    teams: teams.nodes,
  });
```

### Display the data

Now, we need to display the data. We will use a simple template engine called [pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug), which allows us to quickly render an HTML page with the data returned from Linear.

Install the dependency and set it as the default view engine:

```shell
npm i pug
```

```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'pug');
```

Define the pug template by creating a `views` folder and the name of the view. In our case, itâ€™s called `index.pug`. Add the following code:

```pug
html
head
  title=title
  style
    include ./style.css
body
  .container
    .profile
      .top
        img.pic(src=avatarUrl alt='Linear Avatar')
        h2=name 
        a(href=url) View profile
        p=bio
        span=`Created ${createdIssueCount} issues.`
        form(action="/create-issue" method="post")
          fieldset
            legend(align='left')='Create a new issue'
            .item
              label(for='team')='Select a team'
              select(id='teamId' name='teamId')
                each val in teams
                  option(value=val.id select)=val.name
            .item 
              label(for='title')='Title'
              input(type="text" id='title' name='title')
            .item 
              label(for='description')='Description'
              textarea(name="description" id='description' cols="30" rows="10")
          .send-area
            button.send-button(action='submit')
              i(class="fa-solid fa-bounce fa-comment")
              span='Create issue'
    .issues
      h2 Your last updated open issues (#{issues.length})
      ul
        each val in issues 
          li.issue
            span.identifier=val.identifier
            span.priority=val.priorityLabel
            a(href=val.url title=val.title target="_blank") #{val.title}
            p.issue-description=val.description
```

## Handle issue creation form
To handle the issue creation form, letâ€™s define a new route that receives the POST request that comes with the following information:

Team
Title
Description

```javascript
app.post('/create-issue', handleSession, async (req, res) => {
  const userCredentials = await everyauth.getIdentity('linear', req.session.userId);

  // You don't need to worry about ensuring you have a valid access token, EveryAuth will handle
  // that for you by ensuring a fresh access token is always returned.
  const linearClient = new LinearClient({ accessToken: userCredentials?.accessToken });
  const { teamId, title, description } = req.body;
  const me = await linearClient.viewer;

  const { _issue } = await linearClient.issueCreate({ teamId, title, description, assigneeId: me.id });
  const linearIssue = await linearClient.issue(_issue.id);

  res.render('issue-created', {
    ...linearIssue,
  });
});

```

The `issue-created` view contains the following template:

```pug
html
  head
    title='Issue created'
    style
      include ./style.css
  body
    .success.centered
     p
        i.fa-solid.fa-check
        span='The issue has been created'
    .issue-created-container
        h1=title
        p=description
        p
            i.fa-solid.fa-code-fork
            span=branchName
        .footer
            a.button(href='/')
                i.fa-solid.fa-arrow-left-long.fa-bounce
                span='Go back'
            a.button(href=url target='_blank')
                i.fa-solid.fa-arrow-right-from-bracket.fa-bounce
                span='See created issue'
```

It will look similar to the following image:

Run your application (assuming your code is defined in index.js file)

```shell
node .
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
