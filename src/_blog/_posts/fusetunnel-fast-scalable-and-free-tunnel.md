There are many times where we want to share our localhost app with the world, either for testing purposes, to show progress, demo websites or run personal cloud services from your home. [Fusetunnel](https://github.com/fusebit/tunnel) helps you to do this easily! No need to mess with DNS or deploy to have others test out your changes.

Fusetunnel is great for working with browser testing tools like Browserling or external API callback services like Twilio, which require a public URL for callbacks.

Fusetunnel is Fusebitâ€™s version of [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel).

The main difference with localtunnel (and other tunnels) is that Fusetunnel is **end-to-end encrypted**, giving the user greater security, promoting data protection, and preventing unauthorized access to data.

And itâ€™s free!

Compared to ngrok (alternative paid product), Fusetunnel doesn't have rate limiting, so you can send as much traffic as you want through it.

## How does Fusetunnel work? 

Let's say that you have this simple hello world Node.js app:

![Simple Node.js Hello World](blog-fusetunnel-hello-world.png "Simple Node.js Hello World")

To get the tunnel, first, you have to install it with the following command:

`npm i -g @fusebit/tunnel`

Then run:

`ft -p 3000` 

This will give you a public URL ready to share with the world! No more sharing localhost links by accident ðŸ˜œ.

![Run the command ft -p <backend-service-port>](blog-fusetunnel-ft-command.png "command to get your public URL")

You can also run the quickstart command `npx ft --port 3000` instead.

Open the URL, and voila!

![Public URL](blog-fusetunnel-url.png "public localhost URL ready to share and test")

Now you have a fully encrypted tunnel to the internet.
