Recently Fusebit announced [EveryAuth](https://fusebit.io/blog/everyauth/) project that allows you to integrate with multiple services via OAuth easily. Learn how to use EveryAuth with GitHub API using a GitHub OAuth Application.

You have an existing Express.js application that needs to integrate with GitHub API to display the following information:
- User profile information
- Public repositories

The application will display the authorizing user‚Äôs GitHub profile that looks like the following:

## Configuring EveryAuth

This blog post assumes you already have EveryAuth configured in your development environment. In case you don‚Äôt, follow the [configuration steps](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express#getting-started) from the EveryAuth GitHub Repository.

A basic Express application will look like the following:

```javascript
const express = require('express');

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

Let‚Äôs add support to EveryAuth and configure the GitHub service so we can interact with their API.

## Install dependencies

For interacting with GitHub API from Node.js we will use the official GitHub SDK [Octokit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/octokit)

```shell
npm i octokit
```

Install the [@fusebit/everyauth-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fusebit/everyauth-express) package

```shell
npm i @fusebit/everyauth-express
```

Install the [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) package. Used to generate a unique identifier for the userId.

```shell
npm i uuid
```
Install the [cookie-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session) package to allow your application to establish a session (an HTTP-Only cookie) to store the authorizing user id.

```shell
npm i cookie-session
```

## Add Routes

There are two critical routes we need to add to our application:
- Authorize route
- Finished route

Let‚Äôs understand the role of each route:

### Authorize route

EveryAuth middleware enables your application to perform an authorization flow for a particular service. We will be using [githuboauth](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express/blob/main/docs/githuboauth.md) service to use a GitHub OAuth Application. A GitHub App is also supported. For the example of this blog, either service will work since both applications can act as the authorizing user. Understand when to use [GitHub OAuth Apps vs. GitHub Apps](https://fusebit.io/blog/github-oauth-apps-vs-github-apps).

You don‚Äôt need to configure your own GitHub OAuth App; EveryAuth provides out-of-the-box shared OAuth Clients so that you can get up and running quickly.

EveryAuth simplifies a lot the authorization flow:

```javascript
app.use(
  '/authorize/:userId',
  (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.params.userId) {
      return res.redirect('/');
    }
    return next();
  },
  everyauth.authorize('githuboauth', {
    // The endpoint of your app where control will be returned afterwards
    finishedUrl: '/finished',
    // The user ID of the authenticated user the credentials will be associated with
    mapToUserId: (req) => req.params.userId,
  })
);
```

You can define any name you want for the authorization route. In our previous example, it‚Äôs called `authorize`, but it‚Äôs up to you, and your application needs to use a different name/path. 

### Finished route

After the authorization flow finishes, control is returned to your application by redirecting the user to the configured `finishedUrl` in the `authorize` route.
The redirection includes query parameters that your application can use to know the [operation status](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express#parameters---2).
You can use any path for the route. Just ensure it matches what you have configured in the `finishedUrl` property.
In this route, you can now interact with the GitHub API by leveraging the EveryAuth service to get a fresh access token.
 
We will get the authorizing GitHub user information and public repositories using the REST API.

```javascript
// Get userId from the authorization redirect or via session if already authorized.
const handleSession = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.query.userId) {
    req.session.userId = req.query.userId;
  }
  if (!req.session.userId) {
    return res.redirect('/');
  }
  return next();
};

app.get('/finished', handleSession, async (req, res) => {
  const userCredentials = await everyauth.getIdentity('githuboauth', req.session.userId);
  const client = new Octokit({ auth: userCredentials?.accessToken });
  const { data } = await client.rest.users.getAuthenticated();
  const { data: repos } = await client.request('GET /user/repos', {});
  ... render the data
});
```

Now, we need to display the data. We will use a simple template engine called [pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug), which allows us to quickly render an HTML page with the data returned from GitHub.

Install the dependency and set it as the default view engine:

```shell
npm i pug
```

```javascript
app.set('view engine', 'pug');
```

Define the pug template by creating a `views` folder and the name of the view. In our case, it‚Äôs called `index.pug`. Add the following code:

```pug
html
head
    title=title
    style
    include ./style.css
body
    .container
    .profile
        .top
        img.pic(src=avatar_url alt='GitHub Avatar')
        h2=name 
        a(href=html_url) #{login}
        p=bio
        p.followers
        i(class="fa-solid fa-users")
        span #{followers} followers
        span(class="separator") -
        span #{following} following
        section
        span
            i(class="fa-solid fa-building")
        span #{company}
        section
        span
            i(class="fa fa-location-dot")
        span #{location}
        section
        span
            i(class="fa-brands fa-twitter")
        span 
            a(href=`https://www.twitter.com/${twitter_username}`) #{twitter_username}
        section
        span
            i(class="fa-solid fa-floppy-disk")
        span Using #{used_storage} % #{plan.name} plan storage
    .public-repos
        h2 Your public repositories (#{public_repos.length})
        ul
        each val in public_repos 
            li
            a(href=val.html_url title=val.description target="_blank") #{val.full_name}
            span=val.description
            unless !val.language
                span.lang=val.language

```

Render the data:

```javascript
res.render('index', {
  title: `GitHub Profile for ${data.login}`,
  ...data,
  used_storage: Math.round((data.disk_usage * 100) / data.plan.space, 2),
  public_repos: repos,
})
```

Run your application (assuming your code is defined in index.js file)

```shell
node .
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
