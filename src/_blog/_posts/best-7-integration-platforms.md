An average mid-size company uses around 140 unique apps. A small business uses around 100, and a large enterprise uses around 290 [SaaS products across their business](https://www.blissfully.com/saas-trends/2020-annual-report/#). Just think about it, how many apps do you use per day? Well, companies use a lot more to keep their business running. 

**The great majority of those apps don't make sense in isolation.** Just like you prefer your calendar, email, and Google account synchronized in your phone, it's better for companies of all sizes to have their apps integrated or 'talking to each other.' The integration of apps enables the whole to be greater than the sum of its parts, and every app is carefully considered as part of a bigger business strategy.

Even though the number of unique apps used by companies is quite large, at the same time, **companies are churning through more than 30% of their apps every year**. So if you have a SaaS product, you should probably think about integrating it with existing apps because it's easier for companies to stop using your product if it's not a fundamental part of their business strategy and if they are not integrated with other apps.

Let's say you have a SaaS company that is focused on debt management solutions. Suppose your product can integrate with a CRM such as HubSpot or Salesforce and also has an integration with Slack. In that case, it is much more difficult for your customers to stop using your product because it is deeply integrated with their business process. On the contrary, if the product works in isolation without these integrations, and your customer needs to reduce costs, ditching Deb.oi could be a tentative option for them.

Integration platforms help you solve the problem of integrating apps so you can maintain your focus on your SaaS Company. Some of them are great if you want to connect two apps, others if you want a customizable integration and multiple tenants, and others for people that prefer no-code integration. There are different integration solutions for different needs, and this blog post will explore 7 different integration platforms following 7 criteria:

1. Code / no-code integration
2. Flexibility and customization of the integration
3. Cloud (private or public) / on-premise integration 
4. Who should use it
5. Customer support, documentation, and training 
6. Pricing
7. Number of applications supported

The integration platforms are not ranked in a specific order.
