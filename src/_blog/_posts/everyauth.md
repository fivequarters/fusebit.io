The [fusebit/everyauth-express](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express) project is the easiest way for your app to access APIs like Slack, Salesforce, or Github..

The day has come to add integrations to your app. Say you want to connect to your users' Salesforce, Slack, or HubSpot. The first step is having your users authorize your app to access those APIs. This usually requires you to do the following:

- Register an OAuth client for a specific service.
- Take your users through the OAuth authorization flow.
- Update your database and logic to store and refresh your users' credentials for later use.

The [fusebit/everyauth-express](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express) project makes this authorization and credential management work disappear so that you can focus on the core of your app.

```javascript
import everyauth from '@fusebit/everyauth-express';
import { WebClient } from '@slack/web-api';

// Rapidly add support for users to authorize access to Slack APIs
router.use(
  '/slack',
  everyauth.authorize('slack', {
    finishedUrl: '/slack/finished',
    mapToUserId: async (req) => req.user.id,
  })
);

// Easily use these credentials with the native Slack SDK
router.get('/slack/finished', async (req, res) => {
  const userCredentials = await everyauth.getIdentity('slack', req.user.id);

  const slack = new WebClient(userCredentials.accessToken);
  await slack.chat.postMessage({
    text: 'Hello world from EveryAuth!',
    channel: '#general',
  });

  res.send('Success with EveryAuth');
});
```

## More than OAuth

There is more to calling external APIs from your app than OAuth, just like there is more to electricity than an electric outlet.

### OAuth, Normalized

The [OAuth protocol](https://oauth.net/2/) is designed to allow users of your app to authorize it to call external APIs on their behalf. The protocol has enough flexibility for specific implementations to differ. As a developer, you need to understand the specifics of the individual services you are connecting to. EveryAuth reduces the OAuth learning curve by normalizing the protocol of various services and getting you to access data from them faster.

```javascript
import everyauth from '@fusebit/everyauth-express';

// Single patten, many services
router.use('/slack', everyauth.authorize('slack', { /* ... */ });
router.use('/hubspot', everyauth.authorize('hubspot', { /* ... */ });
router.use('/sfdc', everyauth.authorize('sfdc', { /* ... */ });
router.use('/linear', everyauth.authorize('linear', { /* ... */ });
// ...
```

### Secure, Multi-Tenant OAuth Credentials Storage

After obtaining the authorization to connect to an external web service on behalf of your end-user, your app will usually make the actual API call only later. The OAuth protocol calls this situation _offline access_. It addresses this scenario by supporting _refresh tokens_ - long-lived credentials that must be exchanged for short-lived _access tokens_ closer to calling the target API. Your app must store the refresh tokens and associate them with a specific user or tenant.

EveryAuth provides a secure, multi-tenant credentials storage, backed by [Fusebit](https://fusebit.io), with a flexible indexing capability so that you don't need to change the database schema of your app to store your users' credentials.

```javascript
import everyauth from '@fusebit/everyauth-express';

router.get('/doSomethingWithSlack', async (req, res) => {
  // Look up Slack credentials using keys native to your app
  const myUserId = req.user.id;
  const userCredentials = await everyauth.getIdentity('slack', myUserId);
});
```

### Credentials Lifecycle Management

To call an OAuth-protected third-party API, your app needs to exchange the refresh token for an access token. Although this part of the protocol is fairly standard, differences in implementations between services still exist. In addition to understanding them, your app also needs to keep track of when access tokens expire so that they are refreshed in a timely manner.

EveryAuth abstracts all this logic away from your app, providing you with an access token guaranteed to be current just in time to call the target API of the resource server.

```javascript
import everyauth from '@fusebit/everyauth-express';

router.get('/doSomethingWithSlack', async (req, res) => {
  const userCredentials = await everyauth.getIdentity('slack', req.user.id);
  // userCredentials.accessToken is guaranteed to be fresh
});
```

### Pre-Created OAuth Applications

Your app must be pre-registered with the target platform like Salesforce, Slack, or Google before asking your users for authorization to connect to it on their behalf. The registration process can be as simple as Slack or as gnarly as Google. During the registration process, you usually specify the set of permissions your app will require and are assigned a client ID and client secret that identifies your app.

EveryAuth comes with a number of shared, pre-registered OAuth applications to [popular services](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express#supported-services) with basic permissions so that you can skip this part of the process and get right down to calling the APIs. You can later reconfigure EveryAuth to use your own OAuth client ID and secret with the exact permissions you need using the EveryAuth CLI.

```bash
everyauth service set slack \
  --scope "chat:write users:read channels:read" \
  --clientId "{your-client-id}" \
  --clientSecret "{your-client-secret}"
```

### Express Middleware

To enable your users to authorize your web app to a third-party service using OAuth requires you to add OAuth-specific endpoints to your app. EveryAuth makes it as simple as a few lines of code with the Express middleware for Node.js.

```javascript
import everyauth from '@fusebit/everyauth-express';

// Send your user's browser here to ask for their authorization
router.use(
  '/slack',
  everyauth.authorize('slack', {
    finishedUrl: '/slack/finished',
    mapToUserId: async (req) => req.user.id,
  })
);

// After they authorized, control returns to your app here
router.get('/slack/finished', async (req, res) => {
  const userCredentials = await everyauth.getIdentity('slack', req.user.id);
  // ...
});
```

## How Does EveryAuth Work?

The [fusebit/everyauth-express](https://github.com/fusebit/everyauth-express) project consists of Express middleware, a CLI, and a cloud service that acts as an OAuth broker between your application and the external webservers you are calling.

![EveryAuth](everyauth.png 'EveryAuth')

To ask a user of your app for authorization to a specific third-party API, you direct the user's browser to an endpoint of your app implemented using EveryAuth Express middleware (_/slack_ in the example above). The middleware will then take the browser through a series of redirects to obtain the user's authorization to the target service like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Slack. Control is returned to your application with a final redirect when the process is done.

When the time comes to call an external API, your app communicates again with EveryAuth through _getIdentity_ call to obtain the access token. EveryAuth ensures the access token is always fresh and refreshes it as necessary so that you don't need to think about it.
