## Technologies used

* [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
* [PUG](https://pugjs.org/) as the templating language
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for writing CSS
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpiling and polyfilling JavaScript
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for vendor prefixing CSS
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for compiling the Sass and JavaScript assets
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Airbnb's base configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base) for linting

## Project structure

```
src/
  _components/
    All UI partials
  _data/
    Eleventy data files
  _layouts/
    Base page layouts
  _pages/
    Each individual page template
  assets/
    css/
      index.scss
      All other scss files
    js/
      index.js
      All other js files
    images/
      All images used
    meta/
      Favicon, icons and manifest file
Configuration and build files
```

Files in `assets` will be handled by webpack, Eleventy will transform all of the directories with a leading `_`, and will copy across any `images`.

Eleventyâ€™s output will be to a `build` directory at the root level.

## Blog
Everytime you want to add a post to the blog you should create a markdown file (.md) inside `src/_blog/_posts` folder and set these variables in the front matter. 

**All images should be added inside /src/assets/images/blog folder. When declaring the frontamatter (below section) only reference them by its name, without the full path.**

### How to add images?

```
![Semantic description of image](image.png "Image Title")
```

### How to add videos?

It'll depend if the video is located locally or externally. This would be an example of a video added externally, from Youtube. For more details you can [take a look here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/markdown-guide/#videos)

```
<figure class="post__video">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enMumwvLAug" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe>
</figure>
```

And this is how you can do it with a video located locally (poster is not required).

```
<figure class="post__video" poster="path/to/poster_image.png">
  <video controls="true" allowfullscreen="true">
    <source src="path/to/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="path/to/video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
    <source src="path/to/video.webm" type="video/webm">
  </video>
</figure>
```

### How to add button links and normal links?

For a normal link, just add it like so:

```
[Your Text](https://yourlink.com)
```

For a button link, there are two size options, small and large.

To add a small button link, add a title with the word `CTA_SMALL`:

```
[Your Text](https://yourlink.com 'Install the integration CTA_SMALL')
```

To add a large button link, add a title with the word `CTA_LARGE`:

```
[Your Text](https://yourlink.com 'Install the integration CTA_LARGE')
```
